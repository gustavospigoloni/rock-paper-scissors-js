## Project

We were tasked with creating the game "Rock, paper, scissors" using ONLY javascript. No CSS, and the bare
minimum of HTML to connect the script to the webpage.

## Rules of the Game

    * The main idea is to choose either rock, paper, or scissors as your "weapon" against the computer each round.
    ** Paper will always win agains Rock, but lose to Scissors.
    ** Rock will always win against Scissors, but lose to Paper.
    ** Scissors will always win against paper, but lose to Rock.

    A winner will be determined after 5 rounds have been played!

## How to Play

1. First open your console in your web browswer (after clicking the live link below).
   Ctrl + Shift + J (or Cmd + Shift + J on a Mac)

2. Choose either rock, paper, or scissors and type your choice in the input.
3. After 5 rounds a winner will be declared.
4. Replay the game if desired.
